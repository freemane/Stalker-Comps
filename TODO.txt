ADD FAQ

PAPER

loading quickly
	either fewer cookies
	asynchronous calls
		maybe???
	optimizing code??
	multiple graphs ie most recent, third party connections only

display more info about cookies in table
	on click! - sort of done! (Works, but needs a little work)

delete all button only deletes visible cookies
	when searching -done
restructuring
parsing http headers?? -done
zombie cookies?
	can we even identify them
    -- no

POPUP
	* Do we want the table to only show related cookies to your current page?
		or possibly most recent cookies/ something else
	* css - do we want this to look like the web app?
		might be too dark of a color scheme
	* what info do we want included?
	filters
		only relevant(how is that defined?) cookies

editing cookies
	officially scrapping this?

cutting domains down -done
	fix-- Could have problem if main domains have the same cookie name ie .google.com and google.com both having _utma 

PAPER!!!!
	zombie cookies are interesting
	Focus on educational aspect of the app
	"What's this feature?" - able to turn off
	Tutorial mode?
	Cookie trail?
	Look in http headers with host/referrer stuff

More usability testing!
	* Ask about user knowledge about cookies before
	* Have them delete a cookie from the table
	* Look at FAQ
	* Search for something on the graph/table
	* Thoughts on navigability, aesthetic 


PROBLEMS:
When cookie is deleted in table, page refreshes and goes back to graphic
Why does the graph only load if it's the first tab?
If a cookie cannot be deleted, do we want a notification to alert the user?
