* Table: green/ red expand row circle removed from first row?
* Popup: when there are no cookies for current site, say so
	Css changes
* Tabs: put space back between table and FAQ tabs
* Popover text thing: table goes to the top when clicked
* FAQ: add any new information?
* Graph: add buffer on left and right
* Graph: layout changes
* Table: make background of third party cookie rows light yellow

On first load, show faq
	Commented-out code on the background script

Fix min/max zoom

Try to figure out where you are if you zoom out/in too much (maybe change the bg color of the actual graph?) - add a black outline around graph?

* Look into adding related domains to the expanded cookie cell in the webapp?

Edit Paper (after presentation)

Show information about 3rd party edge when selected

Popover text for things that may not be intuitive. WTF - What's this feature?

PRESENTATION - ya know, do this and stuff.

cutting domains down -done
	fix-- Could have problem if main domains have the same cookie name ie .google.com and google.com both having _utma 

PAPER!!!!
	zombie cookies are interesting
	Focus on educational aspect of the app
	"What's this feature?" - able to turn off
	Tutorial mode?
	Cookie trail?
	Look in http headers with host/referrer stuff

More usability testing!
	* Ask about user knowledge about cookies before
	* Have them delete a cookie from the table
	* Look at FAQ - FIND OUT IF MORE NEEDS TO BE ADDED
	* Search for something on the graph/table
	* Do they know they can expand the cookies in the table?
	* Was the app functional? intuitive? easily navigable? 
	* How did using the app feel? 
	* Thoughts on navigability, aesthetic
